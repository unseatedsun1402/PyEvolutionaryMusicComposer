this is a small text file to explain the variables currently exploited in the evolutionaly generation system
chance of mutation (per phrase/per sequence)
splice point in hetrogenous reproduction
number of sequences
chance of a break

things that could also become variables:
variable probability of a particular scale being selected during mutation;
multiple splice points;
length of genome;
