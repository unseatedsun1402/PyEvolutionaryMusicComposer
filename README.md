This is the description of the final year project

The project uses Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to spawn a population of random genomes that represent melodic phrases
Through the evolution of fit individuals, the new population is evolved from the parent in several new child entities

The evolution will continue until an acceptable solution is found or the user can no longer assess the new populations (a suitable solution is not found within a stuitable time period ie., the user's limited patience)

prerequisites
a midi instrument connected to your host machine

pip install copy
pip install mido

(if not installed)
pip install tkinter
pip install numpy

To run the program:
open and run the Player.py file inside you python interpreter

Use the buttons on screen to play a melody and use the pass fail indifferent buttons to rate the fitness.

The slider on the right of the interface is a tempo adjust setting

The program will finish after 5 rounds of evolution as standard adn output a trained and control melody (trained is option 1)
