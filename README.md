This is the description of the final year project

The project uses Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to spawn a population of random genomes that represent melodic phrases
Through the evolution of fit individuals, the new population is evolved from the parent in several new child entities

The evolution will continue until an acceptable solution is found or the user can no longer assess the new populations (a suitable solution is not found within a stuitable time perios foor the user's patience)
